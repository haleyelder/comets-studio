2025, yup, that is weird to type.

Happy New Year and all that; I've had this post outlined, drafted, and reworked for a few weeks now so here it is! I was looking back on my [last year's goals post](https://www.comets-studio.com/2023recap-2024goals) and saw I didn't really pick any specific goals. As a big plan-ahead person with numerous to do lists, I felt a bit out of place at times without some of the guidance I have set up for myself to work toward. This did not mean grinding for "hustle culture" and "if I'm not productive, I'm not worthy" thoughts; I'd prefer to have something set to work toward, even if it's a crafty project or fitness goal.

We're back with more structure this year!

For most of the year, I'm glad I was able to keep a somewhat consistent running routine and hiking to get outside, but had struggled with some career direction in the latter half. At one point, I thought it was a burnout phase, but kind of shifted to personal resentment? It might be a different term, but I've had feelings of self criticism to my past self for some career based choices I could have made.

The feeling continue to circle back how I've felt I‚Äôve ‚Äúmissed my window‚Äù to get into a certain career, but it hasn‚Äôt stopped me from inching to the end goal. Past me was just starting out in a tech role, needed something to pay the bills, and other factors to work around; there‚Äôs no way to know if an alternate choice would have put me in the "right" place either. So, what is the end goal now?

I'm going to continue working with Python and Javascript for future projects. Lately, ‚Äúthe media‚Äù or whatever hot social media thread has been saying it's not a great market for entry level roles as it once was. Honestly, it sounds pretty similar across the board, not only for technology based roles. For now, I'll keep doing what I'm doing, see goals below, and building in public. If I can't stop brainstorming random project ideas during the day that excite me, it should be worthwhile to pursue, right?

I can't not mention 2024 goals without showing off my [reading goal](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2024/21498539). I raised my annual goal to 25, and hit 40 again! I‚Äôve raised the number to 30 this year and may get a bit closer. I've joined [Storygraph](https://www.thestorygraph.com/) for the fancy graphs, but won't be updating as frequently as Goodreads.


### 2025 Goals n' Things
Sorta Big Three/some things coming up this year:

1. 8k race (already paid for it, so I gotta try)! The ultimate goal is still 10k, at some point, and 1/4 marathon stretch goal (after I found they're .3 mi farther than a 10k, why not?)
2. Complete at least 2 [CS50web](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/) projects. Ideally, complete the entire thing, but I need a big refresher since starting 2 years ago.
3. I have a list of crafty projects to get back into. At least 2 in-progress embroidery kits, a mystery knit, a sweater, and a bomber jacket pattern to sew. üßµ
